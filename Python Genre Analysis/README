Python Genre Analysis

Date: April 3, 2024

Overview
- This project conducts an in-depth analysis of Spotify track genres using Python. By leveraging various datasets, including Spotify's Web API, 
  the project aims to provide insights into genre popularity and correlations between audio features.

Data Summary
- The dataset (train.csv) contains information about Spotify tracks, including 125 genres. It has been compiled and cleaned using Spotify's Web 
  API and Python, presented in a CSV format. The dataset includes columns providing details about each track, such as artists, album name, 
  track name, popularity, duration, and explicit content. Additionally, audio features like danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, 
  speechiness, etc., are included.

Questions Explored
- Popularity distribution across genres
- Correlation between audio features

Methodology
- Data Import: The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame.
- Visualization: Various visualizations are created to explore the data:
  - Graphs displaying popularity distribution across genres.
  - Correlation matrix for audio features.
  - Boxplot comparing danceability across top genres.

Visualizations
- Popularity Distribution Across Genres:
  - Graph displaying all genres based on popularity.
  - Top 30 genres by popularity.
  - Bottom 10 genres by popularity.
- Correlation Matrix of Audio Features:
  - Visualization showing the correlation between various audio features.
Boxplot of Danceability Across Top Genres:
  - Comparison of danceability across the top 5 genres by popularity.

Key Findings
- Pop-film and K-pop are the top genres in popularity.
- Classical music appears among the lowest 10 genres, contrary to expectations.
- Energy and loudness exhibit a high correlation, indicating that energetic tracks tend to be louder.
- Danceability shows a low correlation with energy and loudness, suggesting that high energy and loudness do not necessarily equate to high 
  danceability.

Conclusion
- This analysis provides valuable insights into genre popularity and the relationship between audio features in Spotify tracks. By leveraging 
  Python and visualizations, the project contributes to a better understanding of genre trends and music preferences.
