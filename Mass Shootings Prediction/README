Mass Shootings Predictions

Date: April 3, 2024

Introduction

Problem Statement
- Mass shootings are a pressing issue in America, prompting concerns about their frequency and underlying causes. This project investigates 
  whether there is a correlation between the political party in power within a state and the occurrence of mass shootings.

Importance of the Problem
- The prevalence of mass shootings underscores the urgency of understanding their contributing factors. By identifying potential correlations
  with political affiliation, this study aims to inform evidence-based policy interventions to mitigate mass shootings.

Target Audience
- This project is relevant to the general public, advocacy groups, policymakers, and individuals concerned about gun violence and public 
  safety.

Data Sources

Data Used
- The dataset for this analysis was sourced from the Gun Violence Archive, providing comprehensive records of mass shootings in each state 
  since 2014. Additionally, data from the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections were utilized to determine the political party of each 
  state at the time of the mass shooting incident.

Utility of the Data
- The dataset offers valuable insights into the frequency, location, and characteristics of mass shootings across different states. Analyzing 
  this data can help identify patterns and trends related to mass shooting incidents and their potential correlation with political factors.

Methods/Results

Data Exploration
- Exploratory data analysis involved visualizations such as correlation matrices, line graphs, and bar charts to understand relationships 
  within the data.

Data Preparation
- Preprocessing steps included converting date columns, extracting relevant features, and merging political party data with mass shooting 
  records. New variables, such as total victims involved and total suspects involved, were created for further analysis.

Modeling Approach
- Logistic regression was employed to model the relationship between political party affiliation and mass shooting occurrence. Evaluation
  metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the model's performance.

Results
- The analysis revealed no significant correlation between the political party in power and the incidence of mass shootings. Despite efforts 
  to account for various factors, the logistic regression model achieved an accuracy score of only 49%, indicating limited predictive 
  capability.

Conclusion
- Key findings suggest that political party affiliation alone may not reliably predict mass shooting occurrences. Further research 
  incorporating additional factors such as state gun laws, demographics, and socio-economic indicators is warranted to enhance predictive 
  accuracy. Recommendations include prioritizing fairness, transparency, and accountability throughout the project lifecycle to address 
  ethical concerns and ensure responsible data-driven decision-making.
